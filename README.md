# Tinkercad-Challenge-Winner-Pack-s-
Made mostly for (_Eagle_) on Tinkercad, but anybody can download if they wish to.
The Skin Pack is titled TinkercadSk.mcpack, if this doesnt download, then manually put the folder into this directory: 
C:\Users\(your user, you can check it in your file explorer i think)\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\skin_packs

The Zenith Armor packs probably will work if you just click them in your file explorer, which will also open minecraft. If this doesnt download then you can uncompress it after changing the file extension to .zip and manually put the behavior pack into the development_behavior_packs directory or behavior_packs directory, the same applies for the resource pack, titled Zenith Armor.mcpack initially.
